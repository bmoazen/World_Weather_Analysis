# World_Weather_Analysis
# Summary
In this project, we were tasked with creating an application that looks at weather data from serveral hundred random locations and allows users to input various preferences in order to find an ideal vacation destination as well as a hotel to stay at. To accomplish this, we used API calls to OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve current weather information, as well as to the Google Maps Platform (https://developers.google.com/maps) to retrieve and create maps.

# Included Files
Weather_Database - contains the python code that generates the current weather data for each randomly-chosen city as well as the .csv file with the city data results
