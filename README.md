# World_Weather_Analysis
# Summary
In this project, we were tasked with creating an application that looks at weather data from several hundred random locations and allows users to input various preferences in order to find an ideal vacation destination as well as a hotel to stay at. To accomplish this, we used API calls to OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve current weather information, as well as to the Google Maps Platform (https://developers.google.com/maps) to retrieve and create maps.

# Included Files
**Weather_Database** - contains the python code that generates the current weather data for each randomly-chosen city as well as the .csv file with the city data results <br />
**Vacation_Search** - contains the python code that prompts the user for minimum and maximum preferred temperatures, looks for nearby hotels for each of the randomly-chosen cities that fit the user's criteria, and generates a heatmap with markers for each hotel.  Also included is a .csv file with info for an example of a min and max high temperature of 50 and 80.<br />
**Vaction_Itinerary** - contains python code to create an itinerary of four cities and display a map with driving directions to each city.
